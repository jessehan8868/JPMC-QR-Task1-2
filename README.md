# GasFlow
# GasFlow is a prototype natural gas storage pricing framework that enhances market data granularity and provides a flexible contract pricing engine. It uses historical and forward monthly price snapshots to construct a daily time series of indicative gas prices, extrapolates forward curves beyond available data, and allows for scenario-based pricing of storage contracts with multiple injection and withdrawal dates.
